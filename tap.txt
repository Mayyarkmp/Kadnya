what is a customer?


Front sends a trasncation request to the back, 2 cases:
should we add the transaction to our database immediately or only if the request is valid
1. transaction before validation -> if the credentials are invalid, then the transaction we made is bogus
2. how can validation even be done 


We need to save the Charge in case it gets




In Tap, we get charge_id Redirecturl and status + timestamp + currency amount
in EdfaPay we only get Redirecturl
what should I return to the front, only url?
